      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Anna and I am learning to code.  Before this I worked as a behavioral health technician where I helped people to learn how to live on their own.  I enjoyed it but had to quit due to health reasons.  Since then I have been an independent consultant with pampered chef.  I love it but want something more conisistent.  I also teach kids english online, again a great job but not consistent.</p>
